# Student-Attendence-Management-System
Well it's a simple but with an Rich Interface in WPF (XAML & C#) Project on Attendence Management System for College.

Admin Component:
Default ID as: 20011556-038 and Password: 1234 
Can Add / Remove/ Edit Teachers, Students & Courses
Changing the passwords is also done by administrator.
Can also register students with the courses.

Students Component:
Students can view their attendence in different courses they are registered in. You have to add a student first to login a register course to do so.

Teacher Component (Underdevelopment):
Adding and Editing attendence is not supported yet!
Students Component was test by manually adding data to database.

Further details about the system maybe added in future.
